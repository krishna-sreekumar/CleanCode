review1:

	the variable name is too short and does not explain what it is for when you first see it.
	better solution would be to name it fully (in camel case) what it is, for eg. int elapsedTimeInDays
	
review2:
	
	variable name does not show what kind of data we get from the database
	better solution would be to name it listOfEmployeesFromDb
	
review3:
	
	variable names should not have abbreviations unless they are well known, that includes the data type
	better solution would be to just name them the names: counter, fullName, modifiedDate; instead of adding an abbreviation of the data type as well 

review4:

	parameter variable names need to be clear that they are parameters, instead of adding only a p as that causes ambiguity
	better solution would be to name it paramDay and paramAmount so that it is clear that they are parameters

review5:

	all names follow different naming conventions, which causes inconsistency and does not tell which name is for a variable and which is for a function, etc.
	better solution would be to stick to one naming convention for each different code part,
	const int DAYS_IN_WEEK
	var songs
	bool EraseDatabase() {}
	class Alpaca {}

review6:

	method names are ambiguous, and do not tell what the get; set; functions are for.
	better solution would be to change the name to startWorkDate and modificationTime

review7:
	
	none of the variables are in camel case, which disrupts the decided naming convention for variable names.
	better solution would be to name it employeePhone, workingDays, and workingHours
